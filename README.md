##### Build instructions

To build, you need to get a spotify API key from http://developer.spotify.com and place the appkey.c file in dr-ng/

All dependencies are installed via <a href='http://cocoapods.org'>CocoaPods</a>.

Any track that you add to Spotify from the app will show up in a playlist 'RadioSpot' in your Spotify library.
