This app allows you to add the current track of a radio channel (currently only channels from the Danish Broadcasting Company) to Spotify.


To build, you need to get a spotify API key from http://developer.spotify.com and place the appkey.c file in dr-ng/

You also need to get the BTFSpotify wrapper from http://github.com/grav/btfspotify (will be on CocoaPods soon).

Any track that you add to Spotify from the app will show up in a playlist 'RadioSpot' in your Spotify library.
